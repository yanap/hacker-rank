You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers.
Flip all the bits (1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1 ) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

Example

n = 9 10乗
9 10 = 1001 2乗

. We're working with 32 bits, so:

0000

Return .

Function Description

Complete the flippingBits function in the editor below.

flippingBits has the following parameter(s):

int n: an integer
Returns

int: the unsigned decimal integer result

## Input Format

The first line of the input contains q, the number of queries.
Each of the next q lines contain an integer, n, to process.

Sample Output

2147483648 
4294967294 
4294967295
Explanation

Take 1 for example, as unsigned 32-bits is 00000000000000000000000000000001 and doing the flipping we get 11111111111111111111111111111110 which in turn is 4294967294.
